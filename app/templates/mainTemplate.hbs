<!--
    {{{ activeContent }}} is a Handlebars expression that will evaluate to the
    value of the code between the braces. "activeContent" corresponds to the
    activeContent attribute on the model. Normally the expression has two curly
    braces on either side and is automatically escaped. Handlebars expressions
    with three curly braces prevent the value from being escaped, which is what
    is used here since the content will contain html.
