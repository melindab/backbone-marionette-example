<!--
    The code with the curly braces is called a Handlebars expression. It will
    evaluate to the value of the code between the braces. "activeContent"
    corresponds to the activeContent attribute on the model. Normally the
    expression has two curly braces on either side and is automatically escaped.
    Handlebars expressions with three curly braces prevent the value from being
    escaped, which is what is used here since the content will contain html.

<div class="container">
    {{{ activeContent }}}
</div>
